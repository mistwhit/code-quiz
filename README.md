# Code Quiz

## Description
- My motivation for this project was to build a timed coding assessment that saves high scores  in order to gauge my progress of learning JavaScript fundamentals as compared to my peers. 
- This was accomplished through creating a start button that generates a series of questions, subtracting time for the clock if a question is answered incorrectly, indicating the game is over when the time reaches 0, and saving the user's initals and score.
